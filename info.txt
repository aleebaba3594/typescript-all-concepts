Major Difference between js and ts
Js uses "dynamic types"(resolved at runtime) but ts uses "static types"(set during development).

-> The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!
-> Important: It is string and number (etc.), NOT String, Number etc.

-> errors can be seen on compilation time rather than on runtime(execution).
-> Js checks types during runtime(execution) but Ts checks types during compilation time 
   which means ts types only helps during development before code gets compiled.
-> superset of JS (with js all features + advanced features)
-> A programming language made by microsoft.
-> ts is programming language because we have a compiler(tsc) which converts tsc to js.
-> browser and node cant run typescript, it can run js, so, we write ts and the typescript compiler(tsc)
   will convert all ts code into plain js. So, we can run that code.
-> Interfaces and Generics are non-js features can only be used in ts files.
-> ts also provides Meta-programming features like decorators.
-> ts also provides Tuple type which is a special type in ts.A tuple type is a type that represents an
   array with a fixed number of elements of specific types,defined using square brackets [] and the
   types of the elements are separated by commas. 
   example  let value: [string, number] = ["hello", 123];

Type casting:
Type casting can be done in two ways in TypeScript
1) let someValue: any = "hello";
   let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
2) let someValue: any = "hello";
   let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;
